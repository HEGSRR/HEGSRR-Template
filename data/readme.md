# Data

Store all of your research data in subdirectories here. It is recommended that raw data not be altered once downloaded or collected. Maintaining a separate raw data file facilitates reproducibility be preserving a common point of analytical origin. It is similarly recommended that whenever possible data processing, transformation, or manipulation be completed with code as this practice facilitates re-analysis and reduces opportunities of confusion.

Complete the [data_metadata.csv](data_metadata.csv) file indexing each **raw** and **derived** data file, including the fields:

- `path`: the path to the data folder, likely one of: `raw\private`, `raw\public`, `derived\private` or `derived\public`
- `name`: the file name, including extension
- `metadata`: list of metadata files for this data source, stored in the `data\metadata` folder. These may include ISO-191** or FGDC standard `XML` files, data dictionaries, licenses or attributions, user guides, webpage printouts, etc.
- `status`: which may be `included` for data included in the repository or `create` or `acquire` for data that must created or acquired, `derived` for data that will be generated by code from other data files, `simulated` for data that replaces the true research data with a simulated data due to confidentiality or legal constraints, and `unavailable` for data that cannot be shared or reproduced in any way.
- `description`: *very* brief description of the dataset.

Researchers are **strongly encouraged** to include additional metadata in the `metadata` folder.
Further information about the procedures used to create data with 'status = derive' should be maintained in the [procedure_metadata.csv](../procedure/procedure_metadata.csv).

Ideally, metadata should be documented to FGDC or ISO standards and saved in `xml`, `json`, or `yaml` format. Some tools for reading and writing metadata include:
