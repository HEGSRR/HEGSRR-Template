Store sample deidentified data here if the data is required for analysis in a condition in which it still cannot be publicly distributed because of barriers of liscensing, ethics, privacy, or confidentiality.

Data in this folder may be randomized or simulated in order to provide some reproducibility in the case in which preprocessed data must remain private in the `data/clean/private` directory.
