# Data
Store all of your research data. It is recommended that raw data not be altered once downloaded or collected. Maintaining a separate raw data file facilitates reproducibility be preserving a common point of analytical origin. It is similarly recommended that whenever possible data processing, transformation, or manipulation be completed with code as this practice facilitates re-analysis and reduces opportunities of confusion.

Complete the [data_metadata.csv](data_metadata.csv) file indexing each data file, including the fields:

- path
- name
- format
- sources, where sources may be the original data provider for raw data, or the raw files from which data was derived for cleaned data.

Researchers are strongly encouraged to include additional metadata alongside raw data sources.
