# this includes any calls to library(), require(), 
# and double colons such as here::i_am()

# the conflicted package forces you to be explicit about this

# it is best practice to keep R and its packages up to date

# you may need to respond OK in the console to permit groundhog to install packages
# you may need to restart R and rerun this code to load installed packages
# In RStudio, restart r with Session -> Restart Session
