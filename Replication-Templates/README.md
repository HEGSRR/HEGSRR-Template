# Source Materials for the Replication Template

- Camerer et al. (2018) provide an a set of supplemental materials that demonstrate how to write up multiple replications. The authors also maintain a [Model OSF Repository](https://osf.io/pfdyw/) that has a materials section with an excellent set of replication reports of individual studies.
