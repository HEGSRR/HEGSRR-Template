## Pre-registration Template
A pre-registration template for studies involving geographic analyses. This template is modelled on similar templates developed by the [Open Science Framework (OSF)](http://osf.io/x5w7h), [AsPredicted](https://osf.io/fnsb6/), the [prereg package](https://github.com/crsh/prereg), and Van den Akker et al. [(2019)](http://doi:10.31234/osf.io/hvfmr). The OSF template is our most direct source. This template can be used to transparently plan and pre-register original geographic research.

## Reproduction and Replication Template
A template to facilitate the documentation and reporting of reproductions and replications of original geographic research. Stylistically, this template follows the [ReScience article template](https://github.com/ReScience/template), but also draws inspiration from Camerer et al. ([2016](https://osf.io/pfdyw/), [2018](https://osf.io/bzm54/)). Following Camerer et al., we suggest using the template to first document and share the procedures of the planned replication before re-analysis begins. After the reproduction/replication is complete, we suggest then completing the template and sharing the result report alongside the originally published planning document.
