# Data
Store all of your research data. Complete the [metadata.csv](metadata.csv) file indexing each data file, including the fields:

- path
- name
- format
- sources, where sources may be the original data provider for raw data, or the raw files from which data was derived for cleaned data.

Researchers are strongly encouraged to include additional metadata alongside raw data sources.
