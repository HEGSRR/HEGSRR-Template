## Reporting Reproducible Research
Use the resources in this folder to develop a pre-registration plan, document a reproduction or replication, and organize your manuscript.

Also, use this `docs` folder to store websites related to the research project.
In some cases, this `readme.md` document may interfere with GitHub websites.
If this is the case and you have already stored website files in this directory, this `readme.md` file may be renamed or deleted.
