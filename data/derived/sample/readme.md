# Sample Data
Store deidentified samples datasets here, if the data is required for analysis but is in a condition that cannot be publicly distributed because of barriers of liscensing, ethics, privacy, or confidentiality. Data in this folder may be randomized or simulated in order to provide some reproducibility in the cases where preprocessed data must remain private in the `data/clean/private` directory.
