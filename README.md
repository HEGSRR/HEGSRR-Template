# RR-Templates
Template documents and packages for study pre-registration, reproductions, and replications

## Source Materials for the Replication Template
- Camerer et al. (2018) provide an a set of supplemental materials that demonstrate how to write up multiple replications. The authors also maintain a [Model OSF Repository](https://osf.io/pfdyw/) that has a materials section with an excellent set of replication reports of individual studies.
- Camerer et al. (2016) provide a [set of materials and model for replications](https://osf.io/bzm54/) in Experimental Economics. 
- Example of a [Registered Replication Report](https://osf.io/s3hfr/) from the Reproducibility Project: Psychology
- Published materials from [registered replication projects published by the Association of Psychological Science](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/replication/ongoing-projects)
- The replication recipes developed based on Brandt et al. (2014) that are available through the OSF.  
- [Transparency and Openess Promotion (TOP) Guidelines](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/top-guidelines)
- [Replication Policy](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rsos/replication-studies) of The Royal Society
- [Example of a template workflow for species distribution models](https://odmap.wsl.ch/) that the authors converted into a web-based report generator
