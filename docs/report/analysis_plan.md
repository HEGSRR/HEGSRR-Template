### Prior observations  

Prior experience with the study area, prior data collection, or prior observation of the data can compromise the validity of a study, e.g. through p-hacking.
Therefore, disclose any prior experience or observations at the time of study pre-registration here, with example text below:

At the time of this study pre-registration, the authors had _____ prior knowledge of the geography of the study region with regards to the ____ phenomena to be studied.
This study is related to ____ prior studies by the authors

For each primary data source, declare the extent to which authors had already engaged with the data:

- [ ] no data collection has started
- [ ] pilot test data has been collected
- [ ] data collection is in progress and data has not been observed
- [ ] data collection is in progress and __% of data has been observed
- [ ] data collection is complete and data has been observed. Explain how authors have already manipulated / explored the data.

For each secondary source, declare the extent to which authors had already engaged with the data:

- [ ] data is not available yet
- [ ] data is available, but only metadata has been observed
- [ ] metadata and descriptive statistics have been observed
- [ ] metadata and a pilot test subset or sample of the full dataset have been observed
- [ ] the full dataset has been observed. Explain how authors have already manipulated / explored the data.

If pilot test data has been collected or acquired, describe how the researchers observed and analyzed the pilot test, and the extent to which the pilot test influenced the research design.

### Bias and threats to validity

Given the research design and primary data to be collected and/or secondary data to be used, discuss common threats to validity and the approach to mitigating those threats, with an emphasis on geographic threats to validity.

These include:
  - uneven primary data collection due to geographic inaccessibility or other constraints
  - multiple hypothesis testing
  - edge or boundary effects
  - the modifiable areal unit problem
  - nonstationarity
  - spatial dependence or autocorrelation
  - temporal dependence or autocorrelation
  - spatial scale dependency
  - spatial anisotropies
  - confusion of spatial and a-spatial causation
  - ecological fallacy
  - uncertainty e.g. from spatial disaggregation, anonymization, differential privacy

### Data transformations

Describe all data transformations planned to prepare data sources for analysis.
This section should explain with the fullest detail possible how to transform data from the **raw** state at the time of acquisition or observation, to the pre-processed **derived** state ready for the main analysis.
Including steps to check and mitigate sources of **bias** and **threats to validity**.
The method may anticipate **contingencies**, e.g. tests for normality and alternative decisions to make based on the results of the test.
More specifically, all the **geographic** and **variable** transformations required to prepare input data as described in the data and variables section above to match the study's spatio-temporal characteristics as described in the study metadata and study design sections.
Visual workflow diagrams may help communicate the methodology in this section.

Examples of **geographic** transformations include coordinate system transformations, aggregation, disaggregation, spatial interpolation, distance calculations, zonal statistics, etc.

Examples of **variable** transformations include standardization, normalization, constructed variables, imputation, classification, etc.

Be sure to include any steps planned to **exclude** observations with *missing* or *outlier* data, to **group** observations by *attribute* or *geographic* criteria, or to **impute** missing data or apply spatial or temporal **interpolation**.

### Analysis

Describe the methods of analysis that will directly test the hypotheses or provide results to answer the research questions.
This section should explicitly define any spatial / statistical *models* and their *parameters*, including *grouping* criteria, *weighting* criteria, and *significance thresholds*.
Also explain any follow-up analyses or validations.

## Results

Describe how results are to be presented.

## Discussion

Describe how the results are to be interpreted *vis a vis* each hypothesis or research question.

## Integrity Statement

Include an integrity statement - The authors of this preregistration state that they completed this preregistration to the best of their knowledge and that no other preregistration exists pertaining to the same hypotheses and research.
If a prior registration *does* exist, explain the rationale for revising the registration here.
