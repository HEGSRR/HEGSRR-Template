# Scratch Data

Store scratch data used in intermediary processing here. This is also a good place to store specialized databases that cannot be version controlled or redistributed. *This folder is ignored by Git versioning* with the exception of this `readme.md` file by the following lines in `.gitignore`

```gitignore
# Ignore contents of scratch folder, with the exception of its readme file
scratch/**
!scratch/readme.md
```
