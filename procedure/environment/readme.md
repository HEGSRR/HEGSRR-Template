# Environment

Store detailed information about the hardware and software environment requirements for procedures and code here. You may also store a binder or workspace image of the computational environment here.

This directory is specifically for hardware and software environments. Contextual factors or confounds of human subjects research or field research should be communicated in protocol documents and stored in `procedure/protocols`.
