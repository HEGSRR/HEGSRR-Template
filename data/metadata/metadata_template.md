- `Title`: Title of data source
- `Abstract`: Brief description of the data source
- `Spatial Coverage`: Specify the geographic extent of your study. This may be a place name and link to a feature in a gazetteer like GeoNames or OpenStreetMap, or a well known text (WKT) representation of a bounding box.
- `Spatial Resolution`: Specify the spatial resolution as a scale factor, description of the level of detail of each unit of observation (including administrative level of administrative areas), and/or or distance of a raster GRID size
- `Spatial Representation Type`: Specify the model of spatial data representation, e.g. one of `vector`, `grid`, `textTable`, `tin` (triangulated irregular network), etc. If the type is `vector`, also specify the geometry type as in the OGC Simple Feature Access standard (https://www.ogc.org/publications/standard/sfa/) , e.g. `POINT`, `LINESTRING`, `MULTIPOLYGON`, etc. 
- `Spatial Reference System`: Specify the geographic or projected coordinate system for the study
- `Temporal Coverage`: Specify the temporal extent of your study---i.e. the range of time represented by the data observations.
- `Temporal Resolution`: Specify the temporal resolution of your study---i.e. the duration of time for which each observation represents or the revisit period for repeated observations
- `Lineage`: Describe and/or cite data sources and/or methodological steps taken or planned to create this data source, e.g.:
  - sampling scheme, including spatial sampling
  - target sample size and method for determining sample size
  - stopping criteria for data collection and sampling (e.g. sample size, time elapsed)
  - de-identification / anonymization
  - experimental manipulation
- `Distribution`: Describe who will make the data available and how?
- `Constraints`: Legal constraints for *access* or *use* to protect *privacy* or *intellectual property rights*
- `Data Quality`: State any planned quality assessment
- `Variables`: For each variable, enter the following information. If you have two or more variables per data source, you may want to present this information in table form (shown below)
  - `Label`: variable name as used in the data or code
  - `Alias`: intuitive natural language name
  - `Definition`: Short description or definition of the variable. Include measurement units in description.
  - `Type`: data type, e.g. character string, integer, real
  - `Accuracy`: e.g. uncertainty of measurements
  - `Domain`: Expected range of Maximum and Minimum of numerical data, or codes or categories of nominal data, or reference to a standard codebook
  - `Missing Data Value(s)`: Values used to represent missing data and frequency of missing data observations
  - `Missing Data Frequency`: Frequency of missing data observations: not yet known for data to be collected
